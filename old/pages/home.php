            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div class="text">
                <p><big style="font-weight: 500;">Hi</big>, I'm Samantha Goddard RTTP MRSPH and I can help you to
                    achieve your goals and feel confident, calm and in control.</p>
                <p>No matter how long you've been struggling or how overwhelming or impossible your problems seem right
                    now, I can help you to take control and completely transform how you feel. You'll begin to feel the
                    changes from your very first session, and over the course of your treatment, you'll continue to
                    experience new breakthroughs, usually in as little as 1 to 3 sessions. That's why this treatment is
                    called Rapid.
                </p>
                <p><i>"I went deeper into my psyche in one session with you, than in a year and a half of
                        psychotherapy." Robert, Kemsing</i></p>
                <p>You'll develop a heightened sense of awareness about how your mind works, the old programmes that
                    have caused the issues and you'll have the skills to transform your life and solve what's been
                    holding you back. You'll feel supported, empowered and confident.</p>
                <p>I'm a Certified Rapid Transformational Therapy Practitioner, Nutrition and Weight Loss Advisor and
                    Fitness Professional. As a retired professional dancer, I've experienced first-hand the mental
                    blocks that sabotage peak performance. Including self-doubt, rejection, criticism, low self-esteem,
                    feeling not good enough, eating and weight issues. It's a brutal profession but I'm very grateful
                    for the experience, not only because I love dancing and performing, but because it brought me to my
                    new passion, helping others overcome these issues using the power of their subconscious mind.</p>

                            ago and I have been blown away at the change that has occurred in me. I am down a dress
                            size, and almost a stone closer to my ideal body weight. My relationship and
                            thoughts/behaviour with food have radically changed overnight. Up until the session I had
                            struggled for too long. Sam's session reprogrammed my mind, and I now am continuing to allow
                            the program to reinforce my new truth, that I am now a selective, sensible eater and feeling
                            more connected to myself and my life than ever before. Sam is very clearly a talented woman,
                            who genuinely cares. I'm grateful for the attention to detail and conscientious attitude she
                            has."</div>

                            and my response better when life may feel overwhelming. Achieving a sense of calm that
                            inspires others to join in and happiness and true love for me. Working with Sam has been an
                            absolute privilege. Her warmth, kindness, and sincere care for me as an individual was felt
                            from the outset. Sam has been able to help me connect deeper with myself and understand my
                            limitations of what is holding me back from achieving self-acceptance and love. I felt her
                            sense of commitment to helping me. Sam truly emanates positivity and “lives” what she does.
