            <div class="text">
                <p>Rapid Transformational Therapy (RTT) is a hybrid therapy developed and fine-tuned over thirty years
                    by world-renowned therapist Marisa Peer. It combines the most effective principles of Hypnotherapy,
                    NLP, Psychotherapy and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy to bring unparalleled results in one to three
                    sessions.</p>
                <p><i>"Understanding is power and understanding in hypnosis is the most phenomenal power."</i> Marisa Peer</p>
                <p>Your mind holds the information you need to understand the cause of what is holding you back and this
                    method ensures you find it quickly and easily. Empowering your mind to tell your body what to do, so
                    things like depression, anxiety, and weight issues can be permanently overcome.</p>

            <h2>What happens in a session?</h2>
            <div class="text">
                <p>I start by putting you into a very relaxed state of hypnosis. You are always in control and you will
                    remember everything afterwards. In this relaxed state with access to your subconscious mind, we
                    revisit scenes from your life which have everything to do with where your deeper beliefs, which are
                    driving your current behaviours, stemmed from.</p>
                <p>Looking at these scenes through adult eyes, you can give new meaning to them and remove any
                    irrational beliefs that you may have formed as a child. After looking over three or four scenes from
                    your life and working together to understand their meaning for you, I then give your mind
                    suggestions, upgrading you with new helpful, supportive beliefs that are in line with what you want
                    for yourself and your life. You then receive a recording following your session, which you listen to
                    for at least 21 days.</p>
                <p>The mind learns by repetition and by hearing these suggestions every day you are programming yourself
                    with habits of thought which will lead to the right habits of action. This is why RTT works so well
                    for breaking habits like smoking or emotional eating, but it is also brilliant for confidence
                    issues, low self-worth, depression, anxiety and much more.</p>
