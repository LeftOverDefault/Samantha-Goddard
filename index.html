            <div class="content">
                <p><big>Hi</big>, I'm Samantha Goddard, Rapid Transformational Therapist and Member of the Royal Society for Public Health. I can help you to achieve your goals and feel confident, calm and in control.</p>
                <p>No matter how long you've been struggling or how overwhelming or impossible your problems seem right now, I can help you to take control and completely transform how you feel. You'll begin to feel the changes from your very first session, and over the course of your treatment, you'll continue to experience new breakthroughs, usually in as little as 1 to 3 sessions. That's why this treatment is called Rapid.</p>
                <p><i>"I went deeper into my psyche in one session with you, than in a year and a half of psychotherapy." Robert, Kemsing</i></p>
                <p>You'll develop a heightened sense of awareness about how your mind works, the old programmes that have caused the issues and you'll have the skills to transform your life and solve what's been holding you back. You'll feel supported, empowered and confident.</p>
                <p>I'm a Certified Rapid Transformational Therapy Practitioner, Nutrition and Weight Loss Advisor and Fitness Professional. As a retired professional dancer, I've experienced first-hand the mental blocks that sabotage peak performance. Including self-doubt, rejection, criticism, low self-esteem, feeling not good enough, eating and weight issues. It's a brutal profession but I'm very grateful for the experience, not only because I love dancing and performing, but because it brought me to my new passion, helping others overcome these issues using the power of their subconscious mind.</p>
