        <div class="content" style="width:100%;">
            <p><big>Hi</big>, I'm Samantha Goddard, Rapid Transformational Therapist and Member of the Royal Society for Public Health. I can help you to achieve your goals and feel confident, calm and in control.</p>
            <p>No matter how long you've been struggling or how overwhelming or impossible your problems seem right now, I can help you to take control and completely transform how you feel. You'll begin to feel the changes from your very first session, and over the course of your treatment, you'll continue to experience new breakthroughs, usually in as little as 1 to 3 sessions. That's why this treatment is called Rapid.</p>

            <p>You'll develop a heightened sense of awareness about how your mind works, the old programmes that have caused the issues and you'll have the skills to transform your life and solve what's been holding you back. You'll feel supported, empowered and confident.</p>
            <p>I'm a Certified Rapid Transformational Therapy Practitioner, Nutrition and Weight Loss Advisor and Fitness Professional. As a retired professional dancer, I've experienced first-hand the mental blocks that sabotage peak performance. Including self-doubt, rejection, criticism, low self-esteem, feeling not good enough, eating and weight issues. It's a brutal profession but I'm very grateful for the experience, not only because I love dancing and performing, but because it brought me to my new passion, helping others overcome these issues using the power of their subconscious mind.</p>

                    <p>"I experienced Rapid Transformation Therapy with Sam just over a month ago and I have been blown away at the change that has occurred in me. I am down a dress size, and almost a stone closer to my ideal body weight. My relationship and thoughts/behaviour with food have radically changed overnight. Up until the session I had struggled for too long. Sam's session reprogrammed my mind, and I now am continuing to allow the program to reinforce my new truth, that I am now a selective, sensible eater and feeling more connected to myself and my life than ever before. Sam is very clearly a talented woman, who genuinely cares. I'm grateful for the attention to detail and conscientious attitude she has."</p>

I have lost 20lbs with no effort and just feel way more settled and calmer about myself. It really has been so beneficial to me &amp; not something I would have guessed would have had such an effect in the timescales - I'm delighted with the results!”</p>

                    <p>“Sam has helped me rewire my thinking on baggage I was carrying around for 27 years, and the trajectory I am on keeps bringing new wins. Learning to manage myself and my response better when life may feel overwhelming. Achieving a sense of calm that inspires others to join in and happiness and true love for me. Working with Sam has been an absolute privilege. Her warmth, kindness, and sincere care for me as an individual was felt from the outset. Sam has been able to help me connect deeper with myself and understand my limitations of what is holding me back from achieving self-acceptance and love. I felt her sense of commitment to helping me. Sam truly emanates positivity and “lives” what she does. I wish I had been braver to try Hypnosis sooner. Thank you, thank you, thank you!”</p>
