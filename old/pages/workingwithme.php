                <p>If you have spent years dieting and battling with unwanted weight only to find yourself back where
                    you started, then it's time to try a different approach. To truly transform your relationship with
                    food and your body, you need to uncover the root cause that's keeping you stuck. You hold the key to
                    unlocking your natural ability to enjoy a relaxed and healthy relationship with food and yourself.
                    The answers are all in your subconscious mind. I simply facilitate you in getting the understanding
                    and awareness. Once you are aware, you cannot help but change.</p>
                <p>Following your RTT session I send you a personalised, powerful hypnotic recording to wire in these
                    new empowering and motivating beliefs. The repetition of listening to your recording will help
                    cement these beliefs into your subconscious mind. Making healthy choices becomes your automatic
                    choice, exercise becomes something you enjoy and do willingly, feeling good about yourself is your
                    natural state of being.</p>
                <p>You have complete control the whole time. You can talk, move your body, get a tissue, even get up to
                    use the loo! If your session is over Zoom and our call gets disconnected you may drift into sleep if
                    you're really relaxed, but eventually you'll notice that you're not hearing my voice and open your
                    eyes and reconnect our call.</p>
                <p>Hypnosis is not magic, it's science. It's very easy and anyone can do it. Please don't worry about
                    whether you're doing it right, just relax and know that it is working.</p>
                <p>If you're ready to have a chat with me about what you've been struggling with and how I can help,
                    just click on the button below and book a free call. There's no pressure to work with me or sign up,
                    it's simply an informal chat for you to find out more and start to feel better.</p>

                <p>
                    Babies are not born with low self-esteem, anxiety, or issues with body image or weight. These issues
                    are acquired from our perception of the experiences we have. From a young age we start to form
                    beliefs about ourselves and the world around us, some are positive, and some are negative.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We may pick up unhelpful beliefs such as, I'm not good enough, I can't connect, what I want isn't
                    available to me. The good news is, that because these beliefs are something you acquired, you can
                    also choose to let them go, to be free of them and to reconnect to the truth about you, you are
                    enough, you matter, you are lovable, worthy, and deserving.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The wonderful thing is you hold all the answers. Your subconscious mind knows exactly how, when, and
                    why you acquired these limiting beliefs about yourself. It also knows how you can shed them and be
                    free of them. It's my job to facilitate this transformation and to assist you in installing new
                    empowering beliefs about yourself, so you can be free forever of the issues holding you back and
                    keeping you stuck. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having a body you feel comfortable, confident and happy in, is available to you. Feeling deeply
                    connected to yourself and to other people, feeling relaxed and at ease within yourself and when
                    speaking to others is available to you. Liking how you look and having a healthy relationship with
                    food is available to you. Regardless of how long you've been struggling, you can change how you
                    currently feel. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are struggling with anxiety and worrying thoughts, if sleep has become an issue, if you have
                    spent years dieting and battling with unwanted weight only to find yourself back where you started,
                    then it's time to try a different approach.
                </p>

                    Rapid Transformational Therapy is a hybrid form of hypnotherapy, it works with the subconscious,
                    emotional mind. Hypnosis is not magic, it's science, it's easy and anyone can do it. I'll talk you
                    into a relaxed state where you'll experience a heightened state of awareness. I will be talking to
                    you the entire time, and you will actively participate in your session, so you don't need to worry
                    about falling asleep.

                    If your session is over Zoom and our call gets disconnected, you'll notice that you're not hearing
                    my voice and you'll easily be able to open your eyes and reconnect our call and we'll continue the
                    session.

                    sessions is recommended.
